### 3.0.0-alpha.1

New mods

* **Iris** - Optifine shaders! [See here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris#what-shader-packs-can-i-use-right-now) for the recommended ones.

### 1.10.0 (2021-11-01)

An unexpected backport update that matches the mods with 2.3.2 ones, released because 1.9.1 got broken due to a Java 16 and Jumploader issue. For the best experience I recommend upgrading to the latest version though.

### 1.9.1 (2021-05-27)

### 1.7.1 (2021-03-07)

New mods:

Other stuff

* Mods updated

New mods:
* **Hydrogen** - somewhat reduces RAM usage (in my case 2,8 GB -> 2,6 GB)
